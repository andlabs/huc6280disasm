huc6280disasm is a disassembler for HuC6280 code. It tries to analyze code flow, much like IDA does. It disassembles flat boot ROMs for the system, but ROM behavior should match TurboGrafx-16 ROMs. This program is still young (younger than 65816disasm) and doesn't have all the features it should yet (and I seem to have forgotten some of the progress: the TODO file mentions the disassembler not being recursive-descent but it is... huh.).

Usage:
	huc6280disasm [options] ROMfile

Diagnostic messages are printed on standard error. The final disassembly is printed on standard output.

Use -help (or leave no argument) for command line options.

The format of output lines is
	instruction	operand	; ROM address of instruction | logical address of operands, or other info about the operands
There can be multiple of the above, separated by pipes. If you see a (!) in this field, then something went wrong; see the message.

huc6280disasm tries not to make a mistake. It tries to follow the stack and the value of the a register properly as well, but static analysis like this can only go so far, and there may very well still be bugs. Feel free to suggest improvements.

So far I have tested this on a number of ROMs.

This package is go get-table, and does not rely on any external libraries.

The program is released under the terms of the GPLv3 for now. I may make the license more relaxed in the future.

Please feel free to file bug reports and make suggestions.
